I'm Antoine Andrieu. I'm a software engineer that love building efficient architecture and writing beautiful code that solves complex problems. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and user-friendly products that help people and make a difference.

I have been studying web development for ten years and I develop mainly in both Python and Javascript. I build complete applications with REST or GraphQL API linked to PostgreSQL or MongoDB database and ReactJS based frontend. I am also proficient in System Administration and DevOps, including but not limited to writing shell scripts, tweaking, securing and maintaining GNU/Linux servers. I also have a strong emphasis on building continuous integration environment with Gitlab CI/CD and AWS cloud services.

Working in several start-ups in the last ten years, I have an entrepreneurship mindset. I'am also a husband and dad that love doing outdoor activities with my family.
